            <h3>Portfolio Activity</h3>
            <p>
                This Portfolio is to show my abilities and learnings from past years, I am learning to Code and learn how to make websites and apps, the way I like to learn is to watch youtube videos and try to make some changes in the codes from the videos and learn that way,
                I am still learning to code and looking for ideas online to improve.
